    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h1>
        <p> Our project idea is to simulate falling 3D sand as well as other materials, but with a focus on cellular automaton particle simulation rather than realistic physics.
            We also want to add interactions between the materials, such as water particles putting out fire. 
            Ultimately, we want to present a material simulator where users can select and place different blocks of materials and observe how they fall/interact.

    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h1>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-sand_game">Falling-sand</a> type simulation in 3D.</p>
        <p> We are trying to solve the problem of approximately simulating material movement and interactions. 
            This is important because many real world simulators rely heavily on movement/interaction logic and creating an approximate version gives us some experience in building these system models. 
            
            We plan to solve this problem by using cellular automaton logic to determine particle movement. 
            This means we will use a 3D cellular grid to represent our "world" and determine a faalling particle's next position by looking at the 9 cells directly beneath and diagonal to it.
            If 2 materials with a special interaction "touch", i.e. are in adjacent cells, we will perform an interaction.
            This can look like merging the 2 touching cells into a single cell (i.e. water + fire = smoke) or converting both cells into a completely new material (i.e. water + sand = 2 wet sand).
            This problem is challenging in that achieving high performance on large worlds is tough. 
            In conventional 2D worlds you only need to render the splice of world that the user sees. However, in 3D user has pra

    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h1>
        <p>
          Our main goal is to be able to implement a novel 3D sand falling simulation not with physics but with cellular automation. 
          This simulation will include different particles (i.e. sand, water, fire) that will have different behaviors based on the other particles it interacts with. 
          
          Our baseline plan is a window where users can view a world space and place materials by clicking with their cursor. 
          Materials created will fall from their spawned location and settle onto the ground, potentially colliding with other particles beneath it.
          Users will also be able to change the type of material they create.
          When different materials touch, they will simulate some kind of reaction that users can observe.

          Milestone 1: Demo where you see some sand which was there initially fall down correctly and stay on the ground, ability to move around.
          
          Our stretch goals: render blocks as smaller particles with more features,
          use cube marching to smooth out the surface,
          optimize performance via multithreading,
          optimize performance via occlussion culling,
          shaders, lighting.

    <h2 align="middle">Schedule</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Week 1: Viewport and navigation</li>
                <p>
                    Create the initial viewport window and respond to user input (clicks).
                </p>
            <li>Week 2: Simple simulation</li>
                <p>
                    Simulate falling sand placed by users. Sand should "collide" with itself and the ground.
                </p>
            <li>Week 3: More material interaction, and viewport interaction with the world </li>
            <li>Week 4: Design custom textures(as opposed to single color) for particles, tweak the cellular automata algorithm to include wavy patterns </li>
            <li>Week 5: Finish work on final presentation and deliverables</li>
            
            <li>Week 2: Simple simulation, simulate every cell on a smaller world size.</li>
            <li>Week 3: Optimize simulation to only simulate interesing areas, add viewport interaction with the world. </li>
            <li>Week 4: More materials, material interactions. </li>
